# Wallet Intruder
**Wallet Intruder** is a "Mining 2.0" miner. 
All it does is generate 12-word mnemonic phrases, then create bip44, bip49, and bip84 Bitcoin addresses from them, and check if these wallets are in the list of addresses with known balances.

While it may sound intriguing, the likelihood of finding even a single match is extremely low.

Typically, scammers market such programs for approximately $200, therefore, exercise caution if you encounter one.

**If you have purchased this type of software, chances are you have fallen victim to a scam.**

I tried my best to make it work as fast as possible.
This software is real and functional, so feel free to attempt finding a wallet on your own. Best of luck!
